# Quiz
I have created quiz game 
Where there are three questions and three options for each questions(A,B,C)
before player start game they will saw "welcome to quiz game"
player will start the game
if player score is less then 50% i add message "Good Game!"
if player score is between 50% to 100% I add message "Well Done!!!"
if player score is 100% I add message "Great!!! Player"
I have also add some comments.      

The programming principles and software principles used in the game are as follows:
1. The code is divided into well defined functions and structure such as printing welcome message, displaying questions along with their options, getting user input, checking correct answer, calculating total score and printing results. This makes the code modular.
2. The code uses descriptive variable names like questions, options, answers, guesses, and score, making the code more readable and understandable. 
3. The code provides clear and informative messages to the end user, making the game engaging and interactive for the user.
4. The code is generally efficient, avoiding unnecessary computations or redundant operations.
5. Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) is not explicitly used in this simple code, however its principles could be appled to create more complex games.
6. The code is maintainable and easily flexible, so as to add few more questions or answers.
